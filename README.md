<div align="center">
Online mind mapping that supports code writing, single and native.

## Start

type `/code` to switch to code node (ts)

## Why

Xmind is the best mind mapping tool I have used, but it tends to freeze after working with hundreds of nodes. Additionally, I want to be able to write code with highlights within a mind map.
